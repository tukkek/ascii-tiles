# ASCII tile-set
A set of 1,024 16x22 ASCII-style image tiles, provided both as tile-sets and individual Web-P images. Singular tiles are numbered from 1 to 1,024, with redundant copies for named symbols (A to Z; a to z; 0 to 9)...

Much like ASCII-based interfaces, these tile-sets are intended to simplify game-development, in a manner in which it's trivial to migrate to full-graphics at a later point, since the ASCII symbols are them-selves images. As such, they work for mock-up UIs; or delivering ASCII graphics on image-based engines.
